# Chalukas Hashas ✡️

**Chalukas Hashas** is a web application designed to help Jewish communities collaboratively complete the Talmud within a year. Rooted in the meaningful tradition of *chalukas hashas*, the app brings people together to divide and conquer the Talmud’s 2,711 pages, allowing each individual to contribute and track their progress toward a shared goal.

> _This project was commissioned and is showcased as part of my development portfolio._

## What is Chalukas Hashas?

*Chalukas hashas* is a beautiful custom where a community divides the entire Talmud among its members. Each participant commits to studying one or more tractates, and together, they complete the entire Talmud as a group.

This app provides the structure and tools needed to facilitate this collaboration in a digital format.
